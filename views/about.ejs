					<h3>Who Are We?</h3>
					<p>We are a group trying to make difference in the life of orphans by being a mediator among YOU and the Orphanages. We want YOU to find easily all the relevant details through a proper channel. Our goal is to empower all orphans to change their own lives by providing necessary help through the medium of YOU.</p>
					<h3>Our Mission</h3>
					<p>We are here to make a difference.In life we all face adversity. Each struggle is different but still remains equal to the next. We want to be able to help the next person by giving a helping hand. You may be the one who just made a little extra this month and a family helped you last week and you want to pay it forward. Or you may be the one who last week's rent was short and a few kind souls helped you in your time of despair. This website is about connecting hands, accepting help when you need it most or helping a family when you have something you no longer use or need. It could be someone's treasure. Let's connect our hands and make this world a beautiful place, one day at a time.</p>

					<h3>Our Work</h3>
					<p>Through various projects, and partnerships with organizations in place, our aim is to help provide necessary help to the various orphanages.</p>
					<h3>Every Child Needs A Family</h3>
					<p>We believe that each child has the inherent, God-given right to be a part of a loving, caring family. Our work is dedicated to restoring hope to millions of children living as orphans by breaking down barriers between waiting children and loving families. For us, a holistic approach in regard to the spectrum of care needed is crucial, ensuring that each stage of development and need is addressed.</p>
